# Project Information: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Overview

**Problem:** LeetCode #3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Primary Tags:** String, Hash Table, Sliding Window  
**Secondary Tags:** Two Pointers

## Problem Summary

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Key Constraints:**
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Brute Force
- **Time Complexity:** O(n³)
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m,n))
- **Strategy:** Check every possible substring for uniqueness
- **Use Case:** Educational understanding, very small inputs

### 2. Sliding Window with Set
- **Time Complexity:** O(2n) = O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m,n))
- **Strategy:** Two pointers with character set tracking
- **Use Case:** Good balance of clarity and efficiency

### 3. Optimized Sliding Window
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m,n))
- **Strategy:** Hash map with index jumping optimization
- **Use Case:** Optimal solution for interviews and production

### 4. Space-Optimized for Known Charset
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for bounded charset
- **Strategy:** Fixed array instead of hash table
- **Use Case:** Memory-constrained environments with known character sets
